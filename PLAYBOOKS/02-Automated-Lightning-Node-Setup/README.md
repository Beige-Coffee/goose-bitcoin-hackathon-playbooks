# Playbook: Automated Lightning Network Node Setup with LDK

This playbook details how to leverage Block Goose to assist in the development and automation of a custom Lightning Network node using the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK). The focus is on using Goose for code generation, project scaffolding, and automating build/run processes for an LDK-based node, with Alby for testing.

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Description**: Develop a custom Lightning Network node using LDK. This playbook guides you through using Goose to accelerate the creation of core LDK components, project structure, and operational scripts. This approach offers maximum flexibility and deep insight into Lightning operations.
*   **Core Components**:
    *   **Node Architecture**: A custom Lightning node built in Rust using the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK), enabling fine-grained control over functionality and integration.
    *   **Automation & Scaffolding (Goose)**: Scripts and AI-assisted code generation to bootstrap the LDK node project (Rust), manage its build process, implement LDK modules, and automate operational tasks.
    *   **Wallet Integration (Alby)**: Use Alby (via API or browser extension) to fund the LDK node and test sending/receiving payments.

## 2. Why This Project (LDK Focus)?

*   **Deep Learning & Customization**: Building with LDK provides an unparalleled understanding of the Lightning Network protocol and allows for highly tailored node solutions.
*   **Flexibility**: Integrate Lightning capabilities directly into existing applications or build specialized Lightning services.
*   **Skill Development**: Excellent for advanced developers looking to master Lightning Network internals and contribute to the LDK ecosystem.

## 3. Key Roles of Tools

*   **Block Goose Role**: Assists in developing the LDK-based node by:
    *   Generating boilerplate Rust project structures for an LDK node, including `Cargo.toml` setup with `ldk-node`, `ldk-core`, and other relevant LDK/Rust ecosystem dependencies.
    *   Providing Rust code snippets for implementing core LDK components (e.g., `ChannelManager`, `PeerManager`, `ChainMonitor`, `KeysManager`, `BlockSource`, `Logger`, networking handlers, and persistence layers).
    *   Assisting in scripting the setup for on-chain data sourcing (e.g., via an Electrum server or Bitcoin Core RPC).
    *   Helping to write Rust code to handle LDK events, manage on-chain interactions (wallet sync, UTXO management for funding transactions), and implement Lightning payment lifecycle (invoice creation, pathfinding, payment sending/forwarding/receiving).
    *   Generating build scripts (e.g., `build.rs`, Makefiles, or shell scripts) and a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) wrapper for interacting with the custom LDK node.
    *   **Important Reminder**: Building a Lightning node with LDK is a significant engineering task. Code generated or suggested by Goose should be treated as a starting point or template. Always critically review, understand, thoroughly test, and adapt any code to ensure correctness, security, and alignment with LDK best practices. Refer to the official LDK documentation and the "Effectively Using Block Goose & LLMs" section in the main [Best Practices Guide](../COMMON/Best-Practices.md).
*   **Alby Role**: Serves as a user-friendly wallet to:
    *   Fund the new LDK node with initial satoshis via on-chain transactions.
    *   Test sending payments from the new LDK node to an Alby wallet.
    *   Test receiving payments to the new LDK node from an Alby wallet.

## 4. Technical Guide: Building an LDK Node with Goose

### Step 1: Setup Environment

*   **Block Goose**: Installed and configured. See [Goose Setup Guide](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Goose-Setup.md).
*   **Alby**: Account ready for testing. See [Alby Setup Guide](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Alby-Setup.md).
*   **Rust Development Environment**: Ensure Rust (stable toolchain) and Cargo are installed.
*   **Lightning Implementation**: This playbook focuses exclusively on building a custom node using the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK). LDK provides a flexible set of Rust libraries for constructing a tailored Lightning node.
    *   [Lightning Dev Kit (LDK)](https://lightningdevkit.org/)
    *   Consider using `ldk-node` for a higher-level abstraction or `ldk-core` and other crates for a more granular approach.
*   **Operating System**: Linux or macOS are common for LDK development.

### Step 2: Project Scaffolding & LDK Dependency Setup (with Goose)

*   **Goose Task Example**:
    *   `"Generate a new Rust library project named 'my-ldk-node' with a main.rs and a Cargo.toml. Add ldk-node, tokio, and relevant LDK crates (like ldk-core, ldk-net, ldk-persister) as dependencies in Cargo.toml."`
    *   `"Show me how to initialize the LDK Logger and a basic file-based Persister in Rust."`
*   Goose can help create the initial directory structure and `Cargo.toml` file with necessary LDK crates.
*   Setup basic error handling and logging infrastructure for the Rust project.

### Step 3: Implementing Core LDK Logic & Configuration (with Goose)

*   Configuration for an LDK node is primarily handled within the Rust application code, defining how LDK's modules interact.
*   **Goose Task Example**:
    *   `"Generate Rust code to initialize and configure LDK's UserConfig struct, setting parameters like network type (Bitcoin, Testnet, Signet), listening addresses, and channel handshake limits for ldk-node."`
    *   `"Provide Rust code for setting up ldk::chain::chainmonitor::ChainMonitor, including its persistence."`
    *   `"Show me an example of implementing the ldk::chain::Access interface to provide on-chain data (block headers, transactions) to LDK, perhaps using an Electrum client."`
    *   `"Generate a Rust function to initialize the ldk::routing::router::DefaultRouter with a NetworkGraph and scorer."`
*   Goose aids in generating Rust modules for:
    *   On-chain interface (e.g., connecting to `bitcoind` RPC or an Electrum server).
    *   LDK event handling loop.
    *   Persistence for channel data, network graph, and other critical state.
    *   Networking (e.g., using `ldk-net` or a custom networking stack).

### Step 4: Scripting Build, Run & Basic Interactions (with Goose)

*   Interaction will be with the custom LDK node, typically via a purpose-built CLI, an API exposed by the node, or through integration into a larger application.
*   **Goose Task Examples for LDK Implementation (Rust code)**:
    *   `"Generate Rust code using ldk-node to start the node, configure an on-chain wallet (e.g., esplora or RPC), connect to a peer, and list available UTXOs."`
    *   `"Provide a Rust function using LDK (ldk-core and supporting crates) to construct and serialize a BOLT11 invoice, given an amount and preimage."`
    *   `"Show me how to use LDK's ChannelManager to initiate a payment given a route and payment hash/secret."`
    *   `"Draft a Rust function that handles an incoming peer connection and passes it to the PeerManager."`
*   **Goose Task Examples for a Custom CLI (if developed for the LDK node)**:
    *   `"Write a bash script to compile the 'my-ldk-node' Rust project using 'cargo build --release' and then run the resulting binary with a '--get-node-id' argument."`
*   **Key functionalities to implement (with Goose's assistance) and test**:
    *   Node startup and shutdown sequences.
    *   Persistent storage and retrieval of LDK state.
    *   Connecting to peers and maintaining peer connections.
    *   On-chain wallet synchronization and UTXO management for funding.
    *   Opening, managing, and closing Lightning channels.
    *   Generating, sending, and receiving Lightning payments (handling invoices and LDK payment events).
    *   Responding to LDK events appropriately (e.g., `Event::FundingGenerationReady`, `Event::PaymentClaimable`, `Event::ChannelClosed`).

### Step 5: Integrating Alby for Testing

*   **Funding**: Once the LDK node is running, has a synchronized on-chain wallet, and can generate addresses, use your Alby wallet to send BTC to fund it for channel opening.
*   **Testing Channels & Payments**:
    *   After programmatically opening a channel from your LDK node (e.g., to Alby's node or another public node):
        *   Generate an invoice on your LDK node (via its custom CLI or API).
        *   Pay this invoice from your Alby wallet.
        *   Generate an invoice in your Alby wallet.
        *   Pay this Alby invoice from your LDK node.

## 5. Optional Integrations & Extensions

*   **Advanced Wallet Integration**: Interface with more sophisticated external wallet solutions or hardware signing devices for on-chain operations.
*   **Custom Routing Logic**: Implement advanced pathfinding or channel scoring heuristics.
*   **Automated Liquidity Management**: Develop logic within your LDK node for automated channel rebalancing or fee management (e.g., using CLBOSS-like principles adapted for LDK).
*   **Web Interface/API**: Expose node functionalities via a web interface or a REST/gRPC API (Goose can help generate boilerplate for frameworks like Actix, Axum, or Tonic).

## 6. Best Practices for LDK Development

*   **Security**: Prioritize secure key management. LDK provides `KeysManager` which requires careful implementation of its `Sign` traits. Ensure robust handling of seed phrases and private keys.
*   **Persistence**: LDK requires reliable persistence of channel state and other critical data. Thoroughly test your chosen persistence mechanism. Data loss can lead to loss of funds.
*   **Event Handling**: Diligently handle all events emitted by LDK modules. Missed or mishandled events can lead to incorrect state or fund loss.
*   **Asynchronous Rust**: LDK operations are often asynchronous. Leverage Rust's `async/await` and `tokio` (or other async runtimes) effectively.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement unit tests, integration tests (including simulated on-chain events), and end-to-end tests with real testnet nodes.
*   **Stay Updated**: Keep LDK dependencies updated and monitor LDK community channels for best practices and security advisories.
*   Refer to the official [LDK Documentation](https://docs.lightningdevkit.org/) and sample projects.
