# Playbook: Automated Lightning Node Setup with LDK

Use Block Goose to accelerate development of a custom Lightning Network node with the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK). Test with Alby.

## 1. Project Goal

Develop a custom Lightning Node using LDK, with Goose assisting in code generation, project scaffolding, and build/run automation. This offers deep Lightning insight and flexibility.

*   **Core Components**:
    *   Custom LDK Node (Rust)
    *   Automation & Scaffolding (Goose)
    *   Testing Wallet (Alby)
*   **Why LDK?**
    *   Deep Lightning protocol understanding & high customization.
    *   Integrate Lightning directly into apps or build specialized services.
    *   Advanced skill development.

## 2. Tool Roles

*   **Block Goose**: Aids LDK node development:
    *   Generates Rust project structures (`Cargo.toml`, LDK dependencies).
    *   Provides Rust snippets for LDK components (e.g., `ChannelManager`, `PeerManager`, persistence).
    *   Assists with scripting on-chain data sourcing (Electrum/Bitcoin Core).
    *   Helps write Rust for LDK event handling, on-chain interactions, and payment lifecycle.
    *   Generates build scripts and basic CLI wrappers.
    *   **Critical LDK Reminder**: Building an LDK node is complex. Goose-generated code is a starting point. Always critically review, test, and adapt, referencing official LDK docs. See also [Best Practices Guide](../COMMON/Best-Practices.md).
*   **Alby**: User-friendly wallet to:
    *   Fund the LDK node (on-chain).
    *   Test sending/receiving payments to/from the LDK node.

## 3. Technical Guide: LDK Node with Goose

### Step 1: Environment Setup

*   **Block Goose**: Installed & configured. ([Goose Setup](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Goose-Setup.md))
*   **Alby**: Account ready. ([Alby Setup](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Alby-Setup.md))
*   **Rust & Cargo**: Install stable toolchain.
*   **LDK**: Use `ldk-node` (higher-level) or `ldk-core` (granular). ([LDK Website](https://lightningdevkit.org/))
*   **OS**: Linux/macOS common for LDK.

### Step 2: Project Scaffolding & LDK Dependencies (Goose-Assisted)

*   Goose helps create Rust project structure and `Cargo.toml` with LDK crates.
*   **Goose Example**: `Generate a Rust library 'my-ldk-node' with main.rs and Cargo.toml. Add ldk-node, tokio, ldk-core, ldk-net, ldk-persister as dependencies.`
*   **Goose Example**: `Show Rust code to init LDK Logger and a basic file-based Persister.`

### Step 3: Core LDK Logic & Configuration (Goose-Assisted)

*   LDK node configuration is primarily in Rust application code.
*   Goose aids in generating Rust modules for on-chain interface, event handling, persistence, networking.
*   **Goose Example**: `Generate Rust code for LDK's UserConfig: network, listening addresses, channel limits for ldk-node.`
*   **Goose Example**: `Provide Rust for ldk::chain::chainmonitor::ChainMonitor setup, including persistence.`
*   **Goose Example**: `Show implementing ldk::chain::Access interface for on-chain data (e.g., via Electrum).`

### Step 4: Scripting Build, Run & Interactions (Goose-Assisted)

*   Interact with your LDK node via a custom CLI, API, or direct integration.
*   **Key LDK functionalities to implement (with Goose aid):**
    *   Startup/shutdown.
    *   Persistent state.
    *   Peer connections.
    *   On-chain wallet sync & UTXO management.
    *   Channel open/manage/close.
    *   Payment send/receive (invoices, LDK events).
    *   Respond to LDK events (e.g., `FundingGenerationReady`, `PaymentClaimable`).
*   **Goose Examples (Rust for LDK):**
    *   `Generate Rust using ldk-node: start node, configure on-chain wallet (esplora/RPC), connect to peer, list UTXOs.`
    *   `Provide Rust function (ldk-core) to construct & serialize a BOLT11 invoice.`
    *   `Show LDK ChannelManager usage to initiate payment given route & payment hash/secret.`
*   **Goose Example (Custom CLI Script):**
    *   `Write bash script to compile 'my-ldk-node' (cargo build --release) & run binary with '--get-node-id'.`

### Step 5: Testing with Alby

*   **Fund**: Send BTC from Alby to your LDK node's on-chain address.
*   **Test Payments**:
    *   Open channel from LDK node (e.g., to Alby's node).
    *   Create invoice on LDK node; pay from Alby.
    *   Create invoice on Alby; pay from LDK node.

## 4. Advanced Extensions

*   **Sophisticated Wallet Integration**: Hardware signing, advanced external wallets.
*   **Custom Routing**: Advanced pathfinding/scoring.
*   **Automated Liquidity**: Channel rebalancing, fee management.
*   **Web Interface/API**: Expose node functions (Goose can help with Actix, Axum, Tonic boilerplate).

## 5. LDK Development Best Practices

*   **Security**: **Prioritize secure key management** (implement LDK `KeysManager` `Sign` traits carefully).
*   **Persistence**: **Ensure reliable data persistence** (LDK requires it; data loss = fund loss).
*   **Event Handling**: **Diligently handle all LDK events** (missed events = incorrect state/fund loss).
*   **Async Rust**: **Use `async/await` and `tokio` effectively** for LDK's async operations.
*   **Testing**: **Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests**.
*   **Stay Updated**: **Keep LDK dependencies current**; monitor community for advisories.
*   Consult official [LDK Documentation](https://docs.lightningdevkit.org/) and samples.
