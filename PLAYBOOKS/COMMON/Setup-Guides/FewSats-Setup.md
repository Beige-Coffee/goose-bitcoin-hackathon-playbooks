# FewSats Setup Guide

FewSats provides payment infrastructure tailored for AI agents, enabling secure transactions between AI systems. This guide helps you get started with FewSats if your hackathon project involves AI-to-AI payments.

## 1. Understanding FewSats

*   **Purpose**: To allow AI agents to pay each other for services, data, or API calls without breaking their automated workflows.
*   **Key Components**: Typically involves an API and/or CLI tools for integration.

## 2. Sign Up and Get API Credentials

1.  **Visit the FewSats Website**: Go to the official FewSats website (e.g., [fewsats.com](https://www.fewsats.com/) - verify the correct URL from the original context or a quick search).
2.  **Create an Account**: Look for a "Sign Up," "Get Started," or "Developers" section to create a FewSats account.
3.  **Obtain API Key**: Once registered and logged in, navigate to your account settings or developer dashboard to find or generate an API key.
    *   This API key will be used to authenticate your requests when interacting with the FewSats service.
    *   Secure your API key properly. Do not embed it directly in client-side code or public repositories.

## 3. Integration Methods

FewSats may offer a few ways to integrate its services:

*   **FewSats CLI (Command Line Interface)**:
    *   Check the FewSats documentation for instructions on how to install and configure their CLI.
    *   The CLI can be useful for scripting interactions or managing your FewSats account and agent payment settings.
    *   **Example (conceptual)**: `fewsats-cli agent create --name myAIAgent` or `fewsats-cli transaction send --from myAIAgent --to anotherAgent --amount 100`
*   **FewSats API**: For deeper integration into your application code.
    *   Consult the API documentation for endpoints related to:
        *   Registering AI agents.
        *   Initiating payments between agents.
        *   Checking transaction statuses.
        *   Managing agent balances or allowances.
    *   You'll typically make HTTP requests to these endpoints, authenticating with your API key.
*   **FewSats MCP Server (Multi-Currency Payments Server)**:
    *   The original text mentioned "FewSats MCP server for secure AI payments." This suggests a specific component or architecture for handling these payments.
    *   Refer to FewSats documentation ([docs.fewsats.com](https://docs.fewsats.com/) as inferred) for details on how to connect to and use the MCP server if it's relevant to your use case.

## 4. How Block Goose Can Help

*   **Scripting CLI Interactions**: Goose can generate shell scripts to automate FewSats CLI commands.
    *   `goose run --query "Write a bash script to use the (hypothetical) fewsats-cli to send 50 units from agentA to agentB."`
*   **Generating API Client Code**: Goose can help create Python or JavaScript code to interact with the FewSats HTTP API.
    *   `goose run --query "Write a Python function to make a POST request to 'https://api.fewsats.com/v1/payments' with a JSON body containing from_agent, to_agent, and amount, including an Authorization header for an API key."`

## 5. Example Use Case in a Hackathon Project

Imagine a project with two AI agents:
1.  **Agent A**: Analyzes user queries and determines what external data is needed.
2.  **Agent B**: An AI agent that fetches specific data from a paid API (or performs a costly computation).

*   Agent A decides it needs data from Agent B.
*   Agent A uses FewSats to pay Agent B a small amount for the service.
*   Upon payment confirmation via FewSats, Agent B performs its task and returns the data to Agent A.

## 6. Key Considerations

*   **Documentation is Key**: FewSats is a specialized tool. Rely heavily on their official documentation for accurate setup, API endpoints, and usage guidelines.
*   **Security**: Protect your FewSats API key.
*   **Scope for Hackathon**: Integrating AI-to-AI payments can be complex. Ensure this feature is core to your project idea if you choose to implement it, or keep it as an optional extension.

This setup guide provides a general outline. Always refer to the latest official FewSats documentation for the most precise and current information.
