# Lightning Node Setup Guide (Optional)

Overview of Lightning Network integration: full nodes, LDK, and services like Alby.
This is optional; Alby's API suffices for many hackathon projects.

## 1. Why Your Own Lightning Solution?

*   **Full Control (Full Node)**: Manage keys, channels, routing (LND, CLN).
*   **Deep Integration (LDK)**: Embed Lightning logic in your app for custom UIs/cases.
*   **Privacy/Learning**: Enhance privacy; deepen protocol understanding.
*   **Support Network**: Strengthen Lightning (routing nodes).

## 2. Lightning Integration Approaches

*   **Third-Party Service (e.g., Alby API)**: Easiest for hackathons; API handles node ops.
*   **Full Lightning Node (e.g., LND, Core Lightning)**: Run node software, manage channels/liquidity.
*   **Lightning Dev Kit (LDK)**: Library to build Lightning logic into your app (non-custodial, programmatic control).

## 3. Full Node Implementations (LND, CLN, Eclair)

*   **LND**: Go-based. ([LND GitHub](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd))
*   **Core Lightning (CLN)**: C-based, lightweight. ([CLN GitHub](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning))
*   **Eclair**: Scala-based. ([Eclair GitHub](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair))
*   **Hackathon Note**: Full nodes are time-consuming (setup, sync, liquidity). Best if project *focuses* on node management/routing.

## 4. Lightning Dev Kit (LDK) - by Spiral (Block)

LDK is a library, not a standalone node.

*   **Overview**: Flexible Rust library (bindings for Java, C, Swift, Kotlin) to build Lightning into apps.
*   **Key LDK Features**:
    *   Your app *is* (part of) the Lightning node.
    *   Fine-grained control: wallet, channels, networking, on-chain.
    *   Suits mobile apps, LSPs, custom non-custodial solutions.
*   **Learn More**: ([LDK Website](https://lightningdevkit.org/), [LDK GitHub](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning))
*   **Hackathon Note**: For unique Lightning interactions or embedded non-custodial UIs. Steeper learning curve than Alby API, but more flexible if full routing node isn't needed.

## 5. General Prerequisites (Varies by Approach)

*   **Bitcoin Node Access**: Often needed (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, etc.) for chain data.
*   **Hardware**: Dedicated machine/VPS for production full nodes.
*   **OS**: Linux common for full nodes; LDK is more platform-agnostic.

## 6. General Setup Work (Highly Variable)

*   **Full Nodes**: Install Bitcoin Core, then LND/CLN; configure; sync; fund; open channels.
*   **LDK-based Apps**: Integrate LDK library; implement traits (chain, storage, network); manage keys, P2P, on-chain events, channel logic programmatically.
*   Refer to the dedicated LDK playbook for more on building with LDK.

## 7. Automation with Block Goose

*   **Full Nodes**: Goose can script `lncli`/`lightning-cli` commands, generate configs.
*   **LDK**: Goose can help write LDK trait boilerplate, explain LDK API usage.

## 8. Hackathon: Which Lightning Approach?

*   **Time & Complexity**: Full node/deep LDK integration is complex and slow for hackathons.
*   **Match Project Goals**:
    *   **Simple Payments?** **Alby API is usually fastest.**
    *   **Custom In-App Lightning Logic?** **LDK could be a fit.** (See LDK Playbook)
    *   **Node Management/Routing Focus?** **LND/CLN might be necessary.**
*   **Simnet/Testnet**: **Essential** for development to avoid real fund loss.

For most app-focused hackathons, Alby's API is time-efficient. LDK is powerful for custom solutions if time/expertise permit.
