# Best Practices for Hackathon Development

Building robust and secure applications, even within the time constraints of a hackathon, is crucial, especially when dealing with AI and cryptocurrency.

## 1. Security

*   **API Key Management**: This is paramount.
    *   **Never hardcode API keys or secrets** directly into your source code (especially for Alby Client Secrets, LLM API keys, etc.).
    *   **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive keys in environment variables on your development machine and any deployment server.
        *   Example: `export ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_secret_here"`
        *   In Node.js, use `process.env.ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
        *   In Python, use `os.environ.get('ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET')`.
        *   Use a `.env` file (and add `.env` to your `.gitignore`) for local development with libraries like `dotenv` (Node.js) or `python-dotenv` (Python).
    *   **Backend Responsibility**: API calls involving secrets (like Alby's client secret for token generation or sending payments) should **always** be made from your backend server, never directly from client-side JavaScript in a user's browser.
*   **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities like:
    *   Injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection if Goose is creating scripts based on input).
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if displaying user-provided content on web pages.
*   **Control Private Keys**: Ensure users maintain control over their private keys. Tools like Alby are self-custodial. Your application should facilitate interaction, not take custody of keys unless that is an explicit and carefully considered part of the design (and generally not recommended for hackathons).
*   **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits for external services (LLMs, Alby, etc.) to prevent denial of service for your app.
*   **HTTPS**: If deploying a web application, always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
*   **Dependencies**: Use reputable libraries and keep them updated if possible (though for a hackathon, stability over bleeding-edge is often fine). Be mindful of the dependencies you add.

## 2. Performance

*   **Efficient Goose Tasks**: Frame your queries to Block Goose clearly to get efficient and targeted code/automation. Complex or overly broad queries might take longer or produce less useful results.
*   **Caching**: Cache API responses from external services where appropriate to reduce latency and avoid hitting rate limits. For example, if you frequently request the same data that doesn't change often.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous operations (e.g., `async/await` in JavaScript/Python) for I/O-bound tasks like API calls to keep your application responsive.
*   **Optimize AI Interactions**: If using LLMs directly for many small tasks, consider if batching or a more structured approach could be more efficient than many individual prompts.

## 3. User Experience (UX)

*   **Intuitive Interfaces**: Design clear and simple user interfaces. Hackathon judges (and users) appreciate apps that are easy to understand and use.
*   **Clear Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions, especially for transactions (e.g., "Tip sent successfully!", "Payment failed: Insufficient funds", "Generating your summary...").
*   **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling. Display user-friendly error messages instead of raw error codes or stack traces.
*   **Onboarding/Instructions**: If your app has a unique workflow, provide simple instructions or tooltips.

## 4. Code Quality & Collaboration (Even in a Rush)

*   **Version Control (Git)**: Use Git from the start. Commit frequently with meaningful messages. This is a lifesaver if you need to revert changes.
    *   Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files (`.env`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.).
*   **Modular Code**: Try to break down your code into smaller, manageable functions or modules. This makes it easier to debug and for team members to work on different parts.
*   **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your code. Your tired future self (or teammate) will thank you.
*   **Consistent Style**: If working in a team, agree on a basic coding style to keep the codebase readable.

## 5. Documentation & Demo Prep

*   **Links to Official Docs**: Keep links to the official documentation for Goose, Alby, and any other tools you use handy for quick reference and troubleshooting.
*   **README**: Maintain a simple `README.md` for your project, outlining what it does, how to set it up, and how to run it. This is essential for judges and for your future reference.
*   **Prepare Your Demo**: Plan your demonstration. Ensure you can clearly explain:
    *   The problem your project solves.
    *   How it uses the hackathon's theme/tools (Goose, Alby, etc.).
    *   The key features and a live demo of them working.
    *   Technical challenges and what you learned.

## 6. Hackathon-Specific Tips

*   **Start Simple (MVP)**: Focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases the core idea. You can always add more features if you have time.
*   **Time Management**: Allocate your time wisely. Don't get stuck too long on one problem.
*   **Ask for Help**: Don't hesitate to ask mentors or fellow hackers for help if you're stuck.
*   **Stay Hydrated and Rested**: You'll code better!

By keeping these best practices in mind, you can build more impressive, reliable, and secure projects during the hackathon.
