# Best Practices for Hackathon Development

Building robust and secure applications, even within the time constraints of a hackathon, is crucial, especially when dealing with AI and bitcoin.

## 1. Effectively Using Block Goose & LLMs

Block Goose, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), is a transformative tool for hackathons. To get the most out of it, consider these best practices:

*   **Be Specific and Provide Context in Your Queries**:
    *   The quality of Goose's output (code, explanations, scripts) heavily depends on the quality of your input (queries).
    *   Instead of a vague query like: `Goose Task Example: make a bot`
    *   Try a specific one: `Goose Task Example: Write a Python function for a Discord bot using the discord.py library. The function should be named 'parse_tip_command' and take a string argument 'message_content'. It needs to parse messages starting with '!tip @username <amount_sats> [optional_memo]' and return a dictionary with 'recipient', 'amount', and 'memo'. Ensure 'amount' is an integer.`
    *   The more details (language, libraries, function names, desired output, logic) you provide, the better and more relevant Goose's assistance will be.

*   **Iterate and Refine**:
    *   Don't expect perfection on the first attempt. LLMs work best through iterative refinement.
    *   If the first output isn't exactly what you need, ask Goose for modifications:
        *   `Goose Task Example: Refine the previous 'parse_tip_command' function to also handle amounts given in BTC and convert them to sats, assuming a fixed exchange rate of 1 BTC = 50,000,000 sats.`
        *   `Goose Task Example: Can you make the error handling in that script more robust?`
        *   `Goose Task Example: Show me an alternative way to structure that class.`

*   **Break Down Complex Tasks**:
    *   For larger features, don't ask Goose to build the entire thing at once. Decompose the problem into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
    *   Request Goose's help for each sub-task, then integrate the pieces. This makes debugging and understanding easier.
    *   Example: For a tip bot, you might ask for: 1) a message parser, 2) an Alby API call function, 3) a Discord message sending function, and then integrate them.

*   **Specify Your Environment (Languages, Libraries, Frameworks)**:
    *   Always tell Goose which technologies you're using:
        *   `Goose Task Example: Generate a JavaScript snippet to fetch data from an API using the 'axios' library.`
        *   `Goose Task Example: Create a basic HTML structure for a webpage with a form containing two input fields and a submit button, styled with Bootstrap 5.`

*   **Ask for Explanations and Learning**:
    *   If Goose generates code or provides information you don't fully understand, ask for clarification:
        *   `Goose Task Example: Explain the purpose of 'async/await' in the JavaScript code you just provided.`
        *   `Goose Task Example: What are the security implications of the Flask route you suggested?`
    *   Use Goose as a learning tool to deepen your understanding.

*   **Critically Review and Test ALL Generated Output**:
    *   **You are the Engineer**: Goose and LLMs are powerful assistants, but they are not infallible. **You are ultimately responsible for the code and solutions you submit.**
    *   **Verify Correctness**: LLMs can sometimes generate code that looks plausible but is subtly incorrect or inefficient.
    *   **Check for Security**: Always review generated code for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws if code is built from user input, improper handling of secrets, etc.).
    *   **Test Thoroughly**: Treat Goose-generated code as if you wrote it yourself (or as if it came from a new team member). Test it rigorously with various inputs and edge cases.
    *   **Understand, Don't Blindly Copy-Paste**: Make an effort to understand what Goose provides. This will help you debug, modify, and integrate it effectively.

*   **Goose as a Collaborator, Not a Replacement**:
    *   Think of Goose as a very fast pair programmer or an extremely helpful junior developer. It can drastically speed up boilerplate generation, give you starting points, help with unfamiliar APIs, and automate scripting tasks.
    *   However, you still need to drive the overall architecture, make key design decisions, integrate components, and perform final quality assurance.

*   **Be Mindful of LLM Limits (Tokens, Rate Limits)**:
    *   While generally not a major issue for hackathon-scale projects, extremely long conversations or very complex queries can consume more LLM resources. Clear, concise, and well-defined queries are usually more efficient.

## 2. Security

*   **API Key Management**: This is paramount.
    *   **Never hardcode API keys or secrets** directly into your source code (especially for Alby Client Secrets, LLM API keys, etc.).
    *   **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive keys in environment variables on your development machine and any deployment server.
        *   Example: `export ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_secret_here"`
        *   In Node.js, use `process.env.ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
        *   In Python, use `os.environ.get('ALBY_CLIENT_SECRET')`.
        *   Use a `.env` file (and add `.env` to your `.gitignore`) for local development with libraries like `dotenv` (Node.js) or `python-dotenv` (Python).
    *   **Backend Responsibility**: API calls involving secrets (like Alby's client secret for token generation or sending payments) should **always** be made from your backend server, never directly from client-side JavaScript in a user's browser.
*   **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities like:
    *   Injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection if Goose is creating scripts based on input).
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if displaying user-provided content on web pages.
*   **Control Private Keys**: Ensure users maintain control over their private keys. Tools like Alby are self-custodial. Your application should facilitate interaction, not take custody of keys unless that is an explicit and carefully considered part of the design (and generally not recommended for hackathons).
*   **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits for external services (LLMs, Alby, etc.) to prevent denial of service for your app.
*   **HTTPS**: If deploying a web application, always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
*   **Dependencies**: Use reputable libraries and keep them updated if possible (though for a hackathon, stability over bleeding-edge is often fine). Be mindful of the dependencies you add.

## 3. Performance

*   **Efficient Goose Tasks (Covered Above)**: Frame your queries to Block Goose clearly to get efficient and targeted code/automation.
*   **Caching**: Cache API responses from external services where appropriate to reduce latency and avoid hitting rate limits. For example, if you frequently request the same data that doesn't change often.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous operations (e.g., `async/await` in JavaScript/Python) for I/O-bound tasks like API calls to keep your application responsive.
*   **Optimize AI Interactions**: If using LLMs directly for many small tasks, consider if batching or a more structured approach could be more efficient than many individual prompts.

## 4. User Experience (UX)

*   **Intuitive Interfaces**: Design clear and simple user interfaces. Hackathon judges (and users) appreciate apps that are easy to understand and use.
*   **Clear Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions, especially for transactions (e.g., "Tip sent successfully!", "Payment failed: Insufficient funds", "Generating your summary...").
*   **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling. Display user-friendly error messages instead of raw error codes or stack traces.
*   **Onboarding/Instructions**: If your app has a unique workflow, provide simple instructions or tooltips.

## 5. Code Quality & Collaboration (Even in a Rush)

*   **Version Control (Git)**: Use Git from the start. Commit frequently with meaningful messages. This is a lifesaver if you need to revert changes.
    *   Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files (`.env`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.).
*   **Modular Code**: Try to break down your code into smaller, manageable functions or modules. This makes it easier to debug and for team members to work on different parts.
*   **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your code. Your tired future self (or teammate) will thank you.
*   **Consistent Style**: If working in a team, agree on a basic coding style to keep the codebase readable.

## 6. Documentation & Demo Prep

*   **Links to Official Docs**: Keep links to the official documentation for Goose, Alby, and any other tools you use handy for quick reference and troubleshooting.
*   **README**: Maintain a simple `README.md` for your project, outlining what it does, how to set it up, and how to run it. This is essential for judges and for your future reference.
*   **Prepare Your Demo**: Plan your demonstration. Ensure you can clearly explain:
    *   The problem your project solves.
    *   How it uses the hackathon's theme/tools (Goose, Alby, etc.).
    *   The key features and a live demo of them working.
    *   Technical challenges and what you learned.

## 7. Hackathon-Specific Tips

*   **Start Simple (MVP)**: Focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases the core idea. You can always add more features if you have time.
*   **Time Management**: Allocate your time wisely. Don't get stuck too long on one problem.
*   **Ask for Help**: Don't hesitate to ask mentors or fellow hackers for help if you're stuck.
*   **Stay Hydrated and Rested**: You'll code better!

By keeping these best practices in mind, you can build more impressive, reliable, and secure projects during the hackathon.
