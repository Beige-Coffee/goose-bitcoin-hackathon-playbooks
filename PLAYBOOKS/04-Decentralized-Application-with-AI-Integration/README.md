# Playbook: Decentralized Application (dApp) with AI Integration

This playbook explores creating a decentralized application (dApp) where users can pay for AI-generated content or services (e.g., summaries, art, recommendations) using Bitcoin, with Block Goose developing AI components and Alby processing payments.

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Description**: Build a web-based dApp or platform where users can access features or content generated by AI. Access to premium AI services or content is unlocked via Bitcoin (Lightning) payments processed by Alby.
*   **Core Components**:
    *   **Frontend (dApp Interface)**: Web interface for users to interact with the service and make payments.
    *   **AI Service/Content Generator**: The AI model or script that produces the desired output (e.g., text summarization, image generation, data analysis).
    *   **Payment Gateway (Alby)**: Handles Bitcoin/Lightning payments to unlock content/features.
    *   **Backend Logic (Optional but likely)**: To manage user states, content delivery, and interact with the AI and Alby.
    *   **AI Automation (Block Goose)**: To develop AI components, integrate services, and automate parts of the backend/frontend.

## 2. Why This Project?

*   **Monetizing AI**: Explores direct monetization of AI services using crypto.
*   **Web3 + AI**: Combines two cutting-edge technology fields.
*   **Tangible Output**: Users receive clear value (content/service) for their payment.

## 3. Key Roles of Tools

*   **Block Goose Role**: Assists in developing and integrating AI capabilities by:
    *   Generating code for AI content/service components (e.g., Python scripts using pre-trained models like those from Hugging Face, or functions to call external AI APIs like OpenAI).
    *   Helping build backend logic to manage requests, trigger AI services, and serve AI-generated content after payment confirmation.
    *   Assisting with scripting the integration points between the frontend, backend, AI model(s), and the Alby payment system.
    *   Providing starter code for frontend components that display AI-generated content or handle payment interactions.
    *   **Important Reminder**: Integrating AI services and payment systems requires careful attention to detail. Always critically review, understand, and thoroughly test any code generated by Goose, particularly the parts that handle API interactions, data processing, and financial transactions. Refer to the "Effectively Using Block Goose & LLMs" section in the main [Best Practices Guide](../COMMON/Best-Practices.md).
*   **Alby Role**: Processes Bitcoin/Lightning payments:
    *   Generating invoices for users to pay for AI services.
    *   Verifying payment confirmation before unlocking content/features.
    *   (Optional) Handling payouts if the dApp involves revenue sharing.

## 4. Technical Guide

### Step 1: Setup Environment

*   **Block Goose**: Installed and configured. See [Goose Setup Guide](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Goose-Setup.md).
*   **Alby**: Account and API credentials. See [Alby Setup Guide](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/Alby-Setup.md).
*   **Web Development Stack**: E.g., Node.js/Express for backend, React/Vue/HTML+JS for frontend.
*   **AI Model/API**: Decide on the AI service:
    *   **Use an existing API**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, etc. (Goose can help script these API calls).
    *   **Build a simple model**: For a hackathon, a simpler AI task is advisable (e.g., text processing, basic image manipulation). Goose can help generate Python scripts for this.

### Step 2: Design the dApp and AI Service

*   **What AI service will you offer?** Examples:
    *   Article summarizer.
    *   Image style transfer.
    *   Personalized recommendations.
    *   Code explainer.
*   **User Flow**:
    1.  User visits dApp.
    2.  User requests an AI service (e.g., inputs text to summarize).
    3.  dApp presents a Lightning invoice (via Alby) for the service.
    4.  User pays the invoice (using Alby wallet or any Lightning wallet).
    5.  dApp backend verifies payment with Alby.
    6.  AI service is performed, and content is delivered to the user.
*   **Goose Task (Conceptual)**: `goose run --query "Outline the API endpoints needed for a backend that serves AI-generated article summaries, including endpoints for submitting text, getting a payment invoice, and retrieving the summary after payment."`

### Step 3: Develop the AI Component (with Goose)

*   If using an external API:
    *   **Goose Task**: `goose run --query "Write a Python function using the requests library to call the OpenAI completion API with a given prompt and return the generated text. Include error handling."`
*   If building a simple model:
    *   **Goose Task**: `goose run --query "Write a Python script that uses the NLTK library to perform sentence tokenization and select the first 3 sentences as a simple summary of a given text."`

### Step 4: Build the Backend Logic (with Goose)

*   Create API endpoints:
    *   To receive user requests for AI services.
    *   To generate a Lightning invoice using Alby API (`albyClient.createInvoice()`).
    *   To check payment status of an invoice (`albyClient.getInvoiceStatus()` or via Webhooks - advanced).
    *   To trigger the AI service and return content post-payment.
*   **Goose Task**: `goose run --query "Generate a basic Node.js Express backend with an endpoint '/request-summary' that takes text input, calls Alby's createInvoice API, and returns the invoice. Add another endpoint '/get-summary/:invoiceId' that checks invoice status and, if paid, returns a mock summary."`

### Step 5: Create the Frontend (with Goose)

*   Interface for users to input data for the AI service.
*   Display the Lightning invoice (QR code, copyable string).
*   Mechanism to check for payment confirmation and display results.
*   **Goose Task**: `goose run --query "Generate HTML and JavaScript for a simple webpage with a textarea for text input and a button. When the button is clicked, it should POST the text to a backend endpoint '/request-summary', receive a Lightning invoice, and display it as a QR code using a library like qrcode.js."`

### Step 6: Alby Integration for Payments

*   Use Alby SDK/API in the backend to create and check invoices.
*   **Security Note**: Alby API calls should be made from your backend, not directly from the frontend, to protect your API credentials.

## 5. Optional Integrations & Extensions

*   **Lightspark**: For dApps expecting very high payment volumes, Lightspark offers scalable infrastructure. See [Extending with Other Tools](../COMMON/Extending-with-Other-Tools.md).
*   **FewSats**: If the dApp involves multiple AI agents collaborating to produce content (and needing to pay each other), FewSats could be used. See [FewSats Setup Guide](../COMMON/Setup-Guides/FewSats-Setup.md) and [Extending with Other Tools](../COMMON/Extending-with-Other-Tools.md).
*   **User Accounts**: Basic user authentication to save history or preferences.
*   **Subscription Models**: Pay for ongoing access instead of per-use.
*   **Decentralized Storage**: Store AI-generated content on IPFS/Arweave.

## 6. Best Practices

*   **Protect API Keys**: Alby API keys and any AI service API keys must be kept on the backend and secured. See [Best Practices Guide](../COMMON/Best-Practices.md).
*   **Clear Pricing**: Users should understand how much the AI service costs.
*   **Reliable Payment Verification**: Ensure payments are confirmed before delivering premium content/services.
*   **Scalability (Consideration)**: For a hackathon, focus on a working prototype. Real-world dApps would need to consider scaling the AI service and payment handling.

This project type has a high potential for creating a novel and engaging user experience at the intersection of AI and Web3.
