## Why Goose + Bitcoin for this Hackathon? ü§î

*   **Accelerate Prototyping with Playbook-Driven Development**: Use Goose, guided by the detailed examples in these playbooks (e.g., `01-AI-Powered-Bitcoin-Tip-Bot`, `02-Automated-Lightning-Node-Setup`), to rapidly generate Bitcoin/Lightning-specific code, automate tedious configurations, and scaffold core application components. This means less time on boilerplate and more time iterating on your unique hackathon idea.
*   **Rapidly Implement Advanced Bitcoin/Lightning Features**: Leverage Goose to quickly integrate complex functionalities showcased in our playbooks‚Äîsuch as LDK node mechanics, Alby wallet interactions, or AI-driven payment logic. What might take days of research can be prototyped in hours, giving you a competitive edge.
*   **Build More Ambitious Projects, Faster**: These playbooks provide the strategic starting points. Goose acts as your AI co-developer to extend these foundations, enabling you to tackle more ambitious concepts and deliver a more polished, feature-rich project within the demanding timeframe of the hackathon.
